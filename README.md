## Brief About the Project =>

We plan to study the performance of back-off algorithm based on several factosrs. Analysis of performance parameter is essential for strategic uses of FANET, which is useful in several areas as agriculture, wildlife, urban area etc monitoring. FANETs are also used for surveillance purpose which helps to make action on several things. In order start to design best FANET system we have study its protocol performance we decided to work on medium access protocols where we improve its functionality by study of backoff algorithm using fuzzy-logic based concept. Our main aim to improve the saturation throughput and decrease the packet drop probability with considering delay and fairness index. We will test are our approach on network simulator 3 using fuzzy logic controllers [Conventional Logic- degree of truth].
